# Trans4SOAR: Delving Deep into One-Shot Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Diverse Occlusions

In this work, we focus on skeleton-based one-shot action recognition with diverse occlusion scenarios. In order to get the realistic synthesized occluded dataset for NTU-120, NTU-60 and Toyota Smart Home, please send the license agreement of the original datasets to pengkunyu1013@gmail.com. After checking the datasets will be sent via email. Thank you for your interests!
